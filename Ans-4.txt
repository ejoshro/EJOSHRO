8. Now try to delete the Pods one by one (first voting Pod, then worker pod, then db pod) and see what happens to the voting and result app after deleting.
Ans- Voting app is do accounting of vote and remove replication of vote.
If we delete any pod it will recreate as it is replicaset and there will be one pod to serve service.

After deleteing of db pod voting app stop working as it store the voting count. Without that it will not consider voting.
Voting app work properly we need to redeploy DB pod. We will use below command to redeploy voting app.
kubectl apply -f db.yaml .

your comment on WHY result app STOPPED working after db pod stop
As DB pod is not there so no storage of voting from user. To present the data by result pod it take count from DB but as DB not there
it will not work.

your answer to HOW YOU MADE THE RESULT POD work.
Once DB pod is up and working again after redeployment it result app will take count from it and it show the voting count.


As K8 infra is not working i am not able to take logs and screenshots.
